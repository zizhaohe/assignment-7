    "Submit a short (1/2 to 1 page) proposal that outlines and describe your plan for the final project. The proposal should discuss the following aspects of the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the data set(s) you wish to use in the project,\n",
    "- the questions that you want to explore\n",
    "- the analysis methods and techniques that you will use \n",

    "\n",
    "- embedding interactive altair/holoviews plots produced in Python\n",
    "- creating an interactive dashboard of plots using a free-tier server to host your code\n",
